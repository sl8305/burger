# burger

In this fun app, the user will see to lists of burgers. One list will contain burgers that are freshly made and ready to eat. These burgers will be displayed with their names and two buttons. If the user "eats" the burger it will move over to the second list. If the user "deletes" the burger it will no longer show in either list. 

The second list will contain all the burgers the user has "eaten". The user is able to "cook more" and add the burger back to the freshly made burger list or the user can choose to delete the burger from the list if they didn't enjoy the burger. 

Lastly there is a form for the user to add new and exciting burgers to the menu.   
The user will input the name of the special burger and tell the program if the burger was eaten already or freshly made. (The burger will then move accordingly.)
